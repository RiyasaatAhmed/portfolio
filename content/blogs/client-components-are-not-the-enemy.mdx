## Introduction

Client Components have gained an unfair reputation in the Next.js ecosystem.

Some developers treat them as a failure.
Others try to eliminate them entirely.

Both approaches are wrong.

Client Components are **not the enemy** but misuse is.

This article explains **when Client Components are necessary, when they are harmful, and how to use them intentionally in production-grade Next.js applications**.

---

## What Client Components Actually Are

A Client Component is simply a React component that:
- Runs in the browser
- Can use hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`
- Can access browser-only APIs

```ts
"use client";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

They are not new.
What’s new is that **they are no longer the default**.

## The Real Cost of Client Components

Client Components:
- Increase JavaScript sent to the browser
- Add hydration cost
- Can cascade client boundaries unintentionally

This does **not** mean you should avoid them.
It means you should **place them carefully**.

---

## When Client Components Are the Right Choice

I use Client Components when I need:

- Interactivity (clicks, toggles, modals)
- Local UI state
- Browser APIs (`window`, `localStorage`)
- Animations and transitions
- Real-time updates

Example: A modal.

```tsx
"use client";

export function Modal({ children }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open</button>
      {open && <div>{children}</div>}
    </>
  );
}
```

Trying to make this a Server Component would be artificial and harmful.

---

## When Client Components Become a Problem

Client Components cause issues when:

- They wrap entire pages unnecessarily
- They fetch data that could be fetched on the server
- They are used “just in case”

Bad pattern:

```tsx
"use client";

export default function Page() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/posts").then(res => res.json()).then(setData);
  }, []);
}
```

Better pattern:

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getPosts();

  return <PostsClient data={data} />;
}
```

---

## The Boundary Pattern I Follow

My rule is simple:

> **Server Components fetch and prepare data**  
> **Client Components handle interaction**

Example:

```tsx
// Server Component
export async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return <PostsList posts={posts} />;
}
```

```tsx
// Client Component
"use client";

export function PostsList({ posts }) {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <input onChange={e => setFilter(e.target.value)} />
      {posts.filter(p => p.title.includes(filter)).map(...)}
    </>
  );
}
```

This keeps:
- JavaScript minimal
- Components reusable
- Architecture clean

---

## Client Components and Performance

Client Components are not slow by default.

Performance problems usually come from:
- Over-fetching
- Over-rendering
- Poor boundaries

Use:
- `React.memo` when necessary
- `useTransition` for expensive updates
- Dynamic imports for heavy components

Avoid premature optimization.

---

## Common Myths (Debunked)

**Myth:** Client Components are bad  
**Reality:** Unnecessary Client Components are bad

**Myth:** Everything should be a Server Component  
**Reality:** Interactive UIs require the client

**Myth:** Client Components kill SEO  
**Reality:** Server Components control SEO, not client interactivity

---

## Final Thoughts

Client Components are a **tool**, not a failure mode.

If you treat them as:
- UI-focused
- Interaction-driven
- Carefully scoped

They become a strength, not a liability.

The goal is not to eliminate Client Components,
but to **use them deliberately**.

Happy building 👋
